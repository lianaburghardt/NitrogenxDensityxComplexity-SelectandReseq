# NitrogenxDensityxComplexity-SelectandReseq
Data from and analysis of a select and resequence experiment where two Medicago truncatula genotypes were inoculated with a mixture of 68, 8, 3, and 2 Sinorhizobium (Enisfer) meliloti strains. Conducted by Liana Burghardt, Brendan Epstein, Diana Trujillo, Michelle Hoge, and Peter Tiffin in Winter of 2018 at the University of Minnesota. 
Published in final form in Applied Environmental Microbiology as "Host-associated rhizobial fitness: Dependence on nitrogen, density, community complexity, and legume genotype"

The repository is divided into four folders "source" code, "data" files, raw "figures" and "tables" created from source code.
